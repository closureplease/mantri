# Mantri

TraditionaÎ» JS Dependency System.

Mantri takes the powerful [Google Closure tools][closure-tools], hacks them and exposes a robust and developer friendly API to manage your project's dependencies.

## **Mantri** is:

* A Robust and discreet Dependency Management System.
* A Javascript source bundling and minifying tool.
* An intuitive debugging tool.
* A [Grunt][] plugin.
* A command line tool.

## **Mantri** does not:

* *does not* Dictate how you write your code. Vanilla JS, [AMD][], [commonJS][], knock yourselves out.
* *does not* Leave any footprint on the final, production ready, bundled file. No dependencies, no runtime requirements, not a single bit.
* *does not* Require to have any dependency declarations in your production file.


## Quick Start Guide

Currently **Mantri** is only available as a Grunt plugin. Install it via npm:
```
npm install mantri --save-dev
```

And go to the [Mantri as a grunt plugin wiki][grunt-wiki] for the documentation.

## A Fair Warning

**Mantri** is fresh. So fresh the paint hasn't dried yet. We are in the `0.0.x` stage and the API may change radically in the future. Your comments, suggestions, use cases and love are more than required to drive this project forward. So please share your thoughts and concerns by opening an issue.
